# Bird-Sound-Classifier:

## Problem Statement:
we will use your machine learning skills to identify bird species by sound. Specifically, we will develop a model that can process continuous audio data
and then acoustically recognize the species. The best entries will be able to train reliable classifiers with limited training data.


## What I have done ?

I designed a model who classify bird sounds by using there spectrograms. I used transfer learning to use built in model named resnet CNN and I also designed a model of CNN by using sigmoid function named RELU.
